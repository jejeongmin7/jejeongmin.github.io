Term : September 1st, 2019

Place : EXCO seminar room at DAEGU

Main activity contents : In the morning, set up a education textbook, a laptop, an outlet, a power strip and a micro : bit kit and then promote and survey many people at EXCO.
In the afternoon, operated information booth. In addition helped and taught student who can't keep up as a class mentor from 1 p.m ~ 5 p.m

My role : set up materials, operate information booth, promote and survey, class mentor

My thought and what i learned : I was overwhelmed with my first educational activity at DAEGU EXCO seminar room. However, I was able to adapt while i progress club promotion and survey for the first schedule. Running the information booth, I learned how to attract people and how to make it easier to access. Progressing the class mentor, I was able to gain precious time and experience while I keep thinking myself 'How can I make education easier and more fun to others?'.

[The day before educational activity at the creative convergence education fair of the Korea, I stayed in school guestroom.]

On behalf on Daegu Software High School , I was in charge of class mentor, booth operation and booth promotion at the Creative Convergence Education Fair of the Korea!!






<hr/>



After I arrived at the school guestroom, It was dinner time and school teacher bought me dinner with my friends and seniors!





<hr/>


The morning of the Education activity, I got up early, washed my body, loaded my luggage on the bus!

























<hr/>

Arrived at DAEGU EXCO where Micro:bit class, booth will be held!!


As I thought, DAEGU EXCO was so big and so many people!

Arrive at the booth and set up for the Micro: bit class and booth operation.

The staff was very busy and had to set up for an hour before the booth could be run!

Photo: Micro: bit class and booth operation from 11 am to 5 pm!


The booth is open from 11am to 5pm, so you can see the various games and have a questionnaire about what kind of subject you would like to do next!!!

<hr/>


Classes are taught as class mentors from 1:30 pm to 3:00 pm and 3:30 pm to 5:00 pm!


<hr/>



The class presentor went out and explained the overall flow and framework and told the students specifically how it would be made.






<hr/>

Class mentors retaught students who couldn't keep up with the class and replaced Micro: bit parts if they were missing or broken.






















































<hr/>


At 5 pm, after taking all classes and booths, and after all the cleaning and tidying up, taked a group photo!

<hr/>







<hr/>

Leaving EXCO at the end of a hard and really fun and meaningful time, the day I was able to see my potential!

<hr/>


My main activity were this : 


1 ) In the morning, set up a education textbook, a laptop, an outlet, a power strip and a micro : bit kit and then promote and survey many people at EXCO.


2 ) In the afternoon, operated information booth. In addition helped and taught student who can't keep up as a class mentor from 1 p.m ~ 5 p.m

My feelings were this : 

1 ) I was overwhelmed with my first educational activity at DAEGU EXCO seminar room. 

2 ) However, I was able to adapt while i progress club promotion and survey for the first schedule. Running the information booth, I learned how to attract people and how to make it easier to access.

3 ) Progressing the class mentor, I was able to gain precious time and experience while I keep thinking myself 'How can I make education easier and more fun to others?'.

There will be many DUCAMI Education Club events in the future, but I want to donate my knowledge to the students by always working hard without losing my initials!




Thank You !!!
