DUCAMI(교육 봉사 동아리) 

<h1>마이크로비트 교육, 부스 운영</h1>

기간 : 2019년 9월 1일 

장소 : 대구 엑스코 세미나룸

Main activity contents : In the morning, set up a education textbook, a laptop, an outlet, a power strip and a micro : bit kit and then promote and survey many people at EXCO.
In the afternoon, operated information booth. In addition helped and taught student who can't keep up as a class mentor from 1 p.m ~ 5 p.m

My role : set up materials, operate information booth, promote and survey, class mentor

My thought and what i learned : I was overwhelmed with my first educational activity at DAEGU EXCO seminar room. However, I was able to adapt while i progress club promotion and survey for the first schedule. Running the information booth, I learned how to attract people and how to make it easier to access. Progressing the class mentor, I was able to gain precious time and experience while I keep thinking myself 'How can I make education easier and more fun to others?'.

Leaving EXCO at the end of a hard and really fun and meaningful time, the day I was able to see my potential!

<hr/>


My main activity were this : 


1 ) In the morning, set up a education textbook, a laptop, an outlet, a power strip and a micro : bit kit and then promote and survey many people at EXCO.


2 ) In the afternoon, operated information booth. In addition helped and taught student who can't keep up as a class mentor from 1 p.m ~ 5 p.m

My feelings were this : 

1 ) I was overwhelmed with my first educational activity at DAEGU EXCO seminar room. 

2 ) However, I was able to adapt while i progress club promotion and survey for the first schedule. Running the information booth, I learned how to attract people and how to make it easier to access.

3 ) Progressing the class mentor, I was able to gain precious time and experience while I keep thinking myself 'How can I make education easier and more fun to others?'.

There will be many DUCAMI Education Club events in the future, but I want to donate my knowledge to the students by always working hard without losing my initials!
